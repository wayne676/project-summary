XMLHttpRequest cannot load https://api.twitter.com/oauth/request_token. Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://localhost' is therefore not allowed access. The response had HTTP status code 400.

solution:
$.ajax({
            dataType:'JSONP',
            url:"https://api.twitter.com/oauth/request_token", 
            ...
            ...
            }
